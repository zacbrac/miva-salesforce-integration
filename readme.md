#Set up#

1. Take the mvt code from `salesforce_call.mvt` and place that on the INVC page, preferably in it's own item.

2. Upload your project after updating the dependancies via composer.

3. Update the mvt:call on `salesforce_call.mvt` so that the code targets the correct file.

4. Update the WEBMASTER_EMAIL in `functions.php` so that you can receive notifications if things don't work correctly.

5. Run a few tests and call it a day.
